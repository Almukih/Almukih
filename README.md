# 🎉 Fun Calculator 🧮

Welcome to the **Fun Calculator** – a beginner-friendly Python program that adds, subtracts, multiplies, and divides two numbers like a boss! 😎

## ✨ Features

- Takes **two numbers** as input (including decimals!)
- Performs **basic arithmetic operations**:
  - Addition ➕
  - Subtraction ➖
  - Multiplication ✖️
  - Division ➗
- Displays results in a fun and friendly way 🎉

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user is prompted to enter the first and second numbers.
2. The program uses `float()` to allow decimal values.
3. It calculates:
   - The **sum** (`num1 + num2`)
   - The **difference** (`num1 - num2`)
   - The **product** (`num1 * num2`)
   - The **quotient** (`num1 / num2`)
4. It then prints the results in a cheerful format!

## ⚠️ Note

- The code assumes the second number **is not zero** when dividing.
- You can easily add a check to avoid a division by zero error if needed.

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Save the code in a file called `fun_calculator.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the program:

```bash
python fun_calculator.py
